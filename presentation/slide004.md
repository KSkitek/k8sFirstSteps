  What is k8s for?

* Imagine you have 100 containers to configure/deploy/keep running...
* Just tell Kubernetes "please keep these containers running for me" :)

* Kubernetes:
  * Is installed on bunch of machines
  * Runs all of the containers on those machines
  * Always tries to reach desired state (i.e. when something dies)
  * Can do everything docker can
  * Can utilize cloud infrastructure (volumes, public IPs, scaling...)
