# Kubernetes first steps

This repository is a "hands on" introduction to kubernetes.

Use slides to gradually introduce new concepts and immediately
try them out on live cluster.

Slides require heavy narration and help during deployment
or reading linked official docs (in that case you don't 
really need those slides).

## Prerequisites:

- basis docker knowledge - this repository just skims docker topics
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
